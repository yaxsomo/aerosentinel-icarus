## Features
- **Comprehensive Telemetry**: Provides real-time data on altitude, velocity, acceleration, positionning and environmental conditions.
- **Autonomous Operation**: Automatically gathers sensors & GPS data, execute extended kalman filter fusion algorithms in cascade, and send the results via UART to the Flight Computer. 
- **Reliability**: Built to withstand harsh temperatures, vibrations, and G-forces for robust performance.
